# MRCH-MR-Template Overview

This is a template built with Unity and Immersal to help you quickly develop MR experiences.  
The default Unity version is **2022.3.30f1**, and the Immersal version is **2.0**.

In theory, this template should work without issues in newer Unity versions (such as Unity 2022 and Unity 6.0), but **they have not been tested**.
